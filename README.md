we had a chat with the lecturer. as kept searching the realtive material, we found that the motivation of our solution is insufficent. though there are some campany stared to step in this area. we are low in awareness of our project, many details are need to work out and make them clear. also due the poor presentation skills,sometimes it's hard for me to deliver my ideas especillay in terms of core concepts. we are not confident our solution which can be adressed by searching more information and doing the valdation. now i realise how hard it is to build a new project. in terms of market side, we have to build a project which really cater for the requirement of market, otherwise the project cant be commercialize. considering of the market, we do have to inveastgate which problems are bothering people,although the fake wine is existing in the world,is seems like our project require the professional knowledges of the wine industry, to be honest, im not familar with wine industry untill i set about doing this project. so in order to finalise the ideas, there are brunch of material which need to digging.
